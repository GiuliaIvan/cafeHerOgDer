# cafeHerOgDer

Cafe HerOgDer was a complex group project that we had to work on, where we had to find a real company
for which to create a website from scratch, going through all the research, design & programming process,
as well as testing everything. We used mainly HTML & CSS, with a few lines of JavaScript, and also Adobe
After Effects, Premiere Pro for the presentation video, Photoshop for website's interface.

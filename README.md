# cafeHerOgDer

Cafe HerOgDer was a complex group project that we had to work on for a Cafe in Aarhus.
We had to find a real company for which to create a website from scratch, going through
all the research, design & programming process, as well as testing everything. We used
mainly HTML & CSS, with a few lines of JavaScript, and also Adobe After Effects, Premiere Pro
for the presentation video, Photoshop for website's interface.
